Randomly Choosing Elements from a Set
======================================

Given a set of items, you want to choose one at random.
You have access to a random number generator, but there's a catch:
You can only generate random bytes!  The bytes are promised to be evenly
random for all values [0-255].  You have to use them to choose a random element from a set of some given size N.

Write the choose() function from python using only random bytes.
